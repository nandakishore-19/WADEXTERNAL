Routing:
With React Router, you can navigate to different components using paths:

Home: https://your-project-name.vercel.app/

Login: https://your-project-name.vercel.app/login

Register: https://your-project-name.vercel.app/register

Balance: https://your-project-name.vercel.app/balance

Transfer: https://your-project-name.vercel.app/transfer

Profile: https://your-project-name.vercel.app/profile

Contact: https://your-project-name.vercel.app/contact

About: https://your-project-name.vercel.app/about

Note: Ensure your React Router is configured to handle client-side routing properly.

2. Netlify
Netlify is another excellent platform for deploying React applications.

Steps:

Push your React app to a GitHub repository.

Visit Netlify and sign in with your GitHub account.

Click on "New site from Git" and connect your repository.

Set the build command to npm run build and the publish directory to build/.

Routing:
To handle client-side routing with React Router on Netlify, add a _redirects file in your public/ folder with the following content:

bash
Copy
Edit

/*    /index.html   200

This ensures that all routes are redirected to index.html, allowing React Router to manage routing.

3. GitHub Pages
GitHub Pages is suitable for hosting static React applications.

Routing:
GitHub Pages doesn't support client-side routing out of the box. To handle this, you can use a HashRouter instead of BrowserRouter in your React app:

jsx
Copy
Edit
import { HashRouter as Router } from 'react-router-dom';

This will ensure that routing works correctly on GitHub Pages.
